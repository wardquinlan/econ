If we overflow gridline array, we get an array out of bounds.  Should probably fix this.

In order to support if() statements without {} blocks, I think I need ANOTHER PARSER PASS.  This pass would go through and insert the {} blocks around the if / else blocks as needed.
This could be a completely different parser, or it could be the same parser with some sort of flag.

The reason we need to do this is because we need to call the parser to get the whole list of tokens to insert into the block ... but we can't directly call the parser as is because
that would evaluate the block.  Which we don't want to do.

We need a parser pass which generates the list of tokens, but WITHOUT ACTUALLY DOING THE EVALUATION.

String getSeriesType(Series series); # returns float, date, boolean

-----

We might also want to add a new column to TIME_SERIES:

LAST_MERGED TIMESTAMP;

We just update each series with the last merge time.  It can be NULL for backwards compatibility purposes.


-----

We might need an isNull() command to see if, for examples, a series' notes is null.

-----

We might need an actual class to represent NULL.  We only need one instance of it.

public class NULL {
  ...
}

In order to implement a "FULL PARSER" there will be a few passes:

1)  Tokenization
2)  Parsing
3)  Evaluation

The Parsing pass will parse tokens into Statements.  Some statements, such as IF statements, will have additional sub-statements.  It might look something like this:

Statement
Statement
Statement
IF-Statement
  IF-Body
    Statement
  ELSE-Body
    Statement
    Statement
    Statement
Statement

Functions definitions are really just Symbols that go into the Symbol Table, like they do today.

The Evaluation pass, then, works primarily on Statements, not on Tokens.  

A regular Statement is really just an Expression tree, something like this:

Statement
  PLUS
    3
    TIMES
    2
    5

Note that my Parser today is a combination of a Parser and an Evaluator.
