If we overflow gridline array, we get an array out of bounds.  Should probably fix this.

String getSeriesType(Series series); # returns float, date, boolean

We might also want to add a new column to TIME_SERIES:

LAST_MERGED TIMESTAMP;

We just update each series with the last merge time.  It can be NULL for backwards compatibility purposes.

I think I will need to do something about comparing TimeSeries.  It breaks the semantics of compares right now.
 
- while statement - and BREAK
- consider AND / OR lhs support in the Binary Operator somehow.  Maybe.
X allow the writing of const's if they are the same value
  => too many use cases esp. considering TimeSeries objects
- rewrite assert() and exitif() as es functions (?)
