Notes
=====

In general I need to completely rethink settings.  Most of current settings are ACTUALLY DEFAULT VALUES.  However, I can foresee:
  - settings.dao.hostname
  - settings.dao.database
  - settings.dao.username
  - settings.dao.password
  - BUT NOTE THAT ALL OF THESE MIGHT JUST GO RIGHT INTO connect() as parameters
  - note that ECON_HOME will remain as an environment variable
  - also note that these will not be checked into GIT

Other settings can include:
  - settings.confirm = FALSE | TRUE
  - if TRUE, then prompt a confirmation for "dangerous" functions, such as insert(), delete(), save()

I have also considered new functions:
  - assert(boolean-condition, "error-message");
  - throws an exception with "error-message" if boolean-condition is false
  - Object read();
  - reads object from stdin (Integer, Float, Boolean, or String)
  - collapse();
  - normalize();
  - save();
  - insert();
  - this could potentially insert right into the datastore, being consistent with functions like data() and meta()
  - delete();
  - takes a date or an index
  - connect()
  - could take parameters to connect
  - disconnect()
  - disconnect current connection, if connected
  - maybe.  Note sure I need this.
  - can maybe only ever allow either 0 or 1 connection per instance, and it is automatically disconnected
  - note that we might want to let the user connect, so that Econ can run without a database at all
  - Object getXXXX(Series);
  - Object setXXXX(Series, Object);
  - XXXX is one of: {Id, Name, Title, Source, SourceId, Notes}
  - String timestamp();
  - size(Series);
      
  
=> I can either return a CONNECTION object, and then later write a "close(CONNECTION);" function.
=> Or I can just throw an exception if you try to connect a second time
=> Just allocated the DAO instance inside the connect() method.  Then test for it inside the getInstance() method.
=> And forgo the close.  That is probably the easiest.


=> Big Question: Should we import data RIGHT INTO MEMORY?  And then call:

> TBOND2 = import("FRED", "DGS2" ...);
> export(TBOND2, 2, "TBOND2", ...);

Know what I mean?  You could even argue the same for Quote data like this:

> CPI = import("TEMPLATE", "/home/ward/c/quote/template/ng.txt", "CPI");
> setSeriesNotes(CPI, "...");
> setSeriesSomething(CPI, "...");
> export(CPI, 253, "CPI", ...);

Need a way to support "conditions" in a series - somehow have to look at series data type
