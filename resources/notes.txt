If we overflow gridline array, we get an array out of bounds.  Should probably fix this.

In order to support if() statements without {} blocks, I think I need ANOTHER PARSER PASS.  This pass would go through and insert the {} blocks around the if / else blocks as needed.
This could be a completely different parser, or it could be the same parser with some sort of flag.

The reason we need to do this is because we need to call the parser to get the whole list of tokens to insert into the block ... but we can't directly call the parser as is because
that would evaluate the block.  Which we don't want to do.

We need a parser pass which generates the list of tokens, but WITHOUT ACTUALLY DOING THE EVALUATION.

We can also define a type() function:

String type(Object object);

Which returns:

- String
- int
- float
- boolean
- Series (... or possibly: FloatSeries, DateSeries, BooleanSeries)

...or possibly:

String type(Object object); # returns just 'Series'

String seriesType(Series series); # returns float, date, boolean

-----

We might also want to add a new column to TIME_SERIES:

LAST_MERGED TIMESTAMP;

We just update each series with the last merge time.  It can be NULL for backwards compatibility purposes.


-----

We might need an isNull() command to see if, for examples, a series' notes is null.
