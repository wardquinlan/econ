- The grid panel can maybe be smaller, and I can put 1 or 2 panels underneath it
- for example:
  - a panel which displays meta information about a selected series
  - a "quote box", possibly displayed as a table (but not necessarily)
 
- Interactive mode can maybe call the Tokenizer / Parser on one single statement at a time
- Just don't throw away the symbol table.  Something like that
- Functions:
  string getenv(String);
  int parseint(String);
  real parsereal(String);
  string readln();
- But we might have to implement something like this, since we don't have while() constructs:
  string readstring();
  int readint();
  real readreal();
  
  --------------------
  
- I think I want to read data directly from FRED.  Virtually all updates get data from FRED, through text files.
- list() should list counts, too
- may want to create an index on DATESTAMP
