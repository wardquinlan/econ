If we overflow gridline array, we get an array out of bounds.  Should probably fix this.

String getSeriesType(Series series); # returns float, date, boolean

We might also want to add a new column to TIME_SERIES:

LAST_MERGED TIMESTAMP;

We just update each series with the last merge time.  It can be NULL for backwards compatibility purposes.

I think I will need to do something about comparing TimeSeries.  It breaks the semantics of compares right now.
 
- while statement - and BREAK and CONTINUE
X allow the writing of const's if they are the same value
  => too many use cases esp. considering TimeSeries objects
X rewrite assert() and exitif() as es functions (?)
  => risky b.c. of use in test scripts.  I removed exitif().

Think about reintroducing ReturnResult. Or simply, only return int's from top level.  Not sure which is best.

defaults.es should probably include a scaler: defaults.chart.scaler=Linear / Log

plot() can probably have extra params removed, but accept say up to 4 charts.  default colours will have to change to default.chart.colour1, ..., colour4

setNotes(), setTitle(), etc ... cannot set null's.

Remove isNull()

printf()
