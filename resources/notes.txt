- The grid panel can maybe be smaller, and I can put 1 or 2 panels underneath it
- for example:
  - a panel which displays meta information about a selected series
  - a "quote box", possibly displayed as a table (but not necessarily)
 
- Interactive mode can maybe call the Tokenizer / Parser on one single statement at a time
- Just don't throw away the symbol table.  Something like that
- Functions:
  string getenv(String);
  int parseint(String);
  real parsereal(String);
  string readln();
- But we might have to implement something like this, since we don't have while() constructs:
  string readstring();
  int readint();
  real readreal();

- I think I want to read data directly from FRED.  Virtually all updates get data from FRED, through text files.
- list() should list counts, too
- may want to create an index on DATESTAMP

  --------------------

  I can probably put things like the DB name, password, and also the FRED account # ... all in settings.ec
  
  There are 2 instances of UIUtils.  The first is used to calculate the width of gridlines, which depends upon minimums / maximums.
  And then the 2nd one is used to actually do the drawing.  But the minimums / maximums might be slightly different when taking the gridlines into account,
  which in turn would affect the gridlines.  It is a bit of a catch-22.  It feels a bit clumsy to be honest.
  
  In practice I think it will work.  However, as a fall-back, I can always just use settings to create a static gridlines width.  I am tempted to do this.
  
  I also note that UITools are on a per-chart basis because they are drawing the gridlines, the chart background, all of that kind of stuff.
  
  But idxBase is on a per-panel basis.  So, I don't think UITools should calculate idxBase or anything like that.
  
  I suppose the # of data points at END can be determined using:
  
  idxBase = Math.max(timeSeriesCollapsed.size() - chartWidth / DXINCR, timeSeriesCollapsed.size());
  
  HOME is simply:
  
  idxBase = 0;
