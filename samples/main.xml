  <!-- maybe I could do something like this:
  - you can only have 1 grid in a panel.  If present, it is left-aligned
  - the grid has no span element.  However, it is dynamically sized so that all columns are just visible
  - all charts within a panel are always vertically aligned, and are automatically synchronized
  - charts have a span="" attribute which control sizing.  all span elements must sum to 100
  - all this implies that there are 2 JPanels: the LHS panel is for grids, and the RHS panel is for all charts
